# CompTIA Security+ Exam (SY0-501): Identity and Access Management

This domain accounts for 16% of the questions on the real exam. We'll be focusing on:

- understanding common identity and access management concepts
- installing and configuring access and identity services
- implementing identity and access management controls
- using common account management processes



## 1. Identification

### 1.1 Identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting

#### Identification

An individual makes a claim about his or her identity. The person trying to gain access doesn't present any proof at this point. They simply make an assertion. 

#### Authentication

Proof comes into play during the authentication process. The individual proves his or her identity to the satisfaction of the access control system.

#### Authorization

Just proving your identity isn't enough to gain access to a system however. The access control system also needs to be satisfied that you are allowed to access the system. That's the third step of the access control process, authorization.

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Remember that identification and authentication are separate and distinct steps

![01_01_IAA](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/01_01_IAA.PNG?raw=true)

#### Triple A

- **A**uthentication
- **A**uthorization
- **A**ccounting

In addition to these processes, access control systems also provide accounting functionality that allows administrators to track user activity and reconstruct it from logs at a later date. Together, the activities of authentication, authorization, and accounting are commonly described as Triple A.



### 1.2 Identification Mechanisms

#### Usernames

- Usually easily identify the individual
- Often consist of a first initial and last name
- Should not be considered secret

Remember, usernames are for identification, not authentication, so there's no need to keep them secret. Obvious usernames make everyone's lives easier.

#### Access Cards

- Often serve as proof of employment
- May perform both identification and authentication

##### Magnetic Stripe Cards

These magnetic stripes are easily duplicated with readily available equipment, so they should not be considered secure. Anyone who gains possession of a magnetic stripe card, or even knows how the card is encoded, can create a copy of that card. 

##### Smart Cards

Contain an integrated circuit chip that works with the card reader to prove the authenticity of the card. 

Some smart cards are read by directly inserting them into a card reader. Chip and pin credit cards use similar technology. 

Contactless smart cards, or proximity cards, simply need to be placed near the reader. An antenna in the card communicates with the reader. Some of these cards, known as **passive cards**, must be placed into or extremely close to the reader to work properly. They receive power from the reader that energizes the chip, so they last indefinitely. Other proximity cards, known as **active cards**, contain batteries and transmitters. They use these batteries and can then transmit over longer distances and be read from several feet away. Toll transponders use this technology. The **disadvantage to active cards** is that they contain batteries and must be replaced periodically. 



### 1.3 Biometrics

**Something You Are**

- Identification and Authentication

#### Good Biometric Systems Provide

- Easy enrollment
- Low false acceptance rates
- Lose false rejection rates
- Low intrusiveness

##### Fingerprint Scans

- Often found on computing devices
- Allow self-enrollment
- Low false rejection and acceptance rates

##### Eye Scans

- Analyze
  - Color pattern of iris
  - Blood vessel of retina
- Seen as highly intrusive by users

Not commonly used outside of high-security physical buildings.

##### Voiceprint Matching

- Requires user to speak a phrase
- Subject to reply attacks
- Often combined with other authentication techniques

##### Facial Recognition

- Scans user's facial structure
- Has a high â€œcreepiness factor"
- Improving error rates

As authentication tools, biometrics are much harder to fool than passwords and other knowledge-based approaches.

## 2. Authentication

### 2.1 Authentication factors

#### Authentication Factors

1. Something you know
2. Something you have
3. Something you are

##### Something You Know

- Normally a password
- Strong passwords are long and complex
- Passphrases are better than passwords 

Chocolate-covered strawberries are for me! -> ChocolateCoveredStrawberriesR4Me!

##### Something You Are

- Biometric authentication
  - Fingerprints
  - Eye scans
  - Facial recognition
  - Voice prints

##### Something you have

- Requires physical possession of a device
  - Smartphone with authentication app
  - Authentication key fob

#### False Acceptance

- System misidentifies an individual as an authorized user.
- Measured by the false acceptance rate (FAR)

This is a very serious error because it allows unauthorized access to the system, device, information, or facility. 

#### False Rejection

- System fails to recognize an authorized user.
- Measured by the false rejection rate (FRR)

This is not as serious as a false acceptance because it does not jeopardize confidentiality or integrity, but it is still a serious error because it jeopardizes the availability of those resources to authorized users. 

**FAR and FRR are not good measures on their own.**

Because they may easily be manipulated. On one extreme, administrators may configure the system to simply admit nobody at all, giving it a perfect false acceptance rate, but also a very high false rejection rate. Similarly, if the system allows anyone access, it has a perfect false rejection rate, but an unacceptably high false acceptance rate. 

#### Crossover Error Rate (CER)

The solution to this measurement problem is to use a balanced measure of authentication strength called CER. The crossover error rate is the error frequency that occurs when administrators tune the system to have equal false acceptance and false rejection rates.

![02_01_CER](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_01_CER.PNG?raw=true)



### 2.2 Multifactor authentication

#### Authentication Factors

1. Something you know
2. Something you have
3. Something you are
4. Somewhere you are (e.g. inside a secure building)
5. Something you do

**Authentication can be tricked!**

#### Multifactor Authentication

- It combines techniques from two or more of the authentication categories: something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are, and something you do

#### Multifactor Examples

- Password (something you know) + Smart Card (something you have)
- Fingerprint (something you are) + PIN (something you know)

#### NOT Multifactor

- Password (something you know) + Security Question (something you know)

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Make sure examples of authentication techniques are *really* different factors!



### 2.3 Something you have

#### Physical and Soft Tokens

- Physical token is replaced by soft-token
- The codes provided on both hardware and software tokens are known as one-time passwords, or OTPs. 

#### Protocols for Generating Codes

##### HMAAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP)

- Uses a shared secret and an incrementing counter to generate the code displayed on the token
- The code changes whenever the button is pushed, and the code is valid until it is used. 

##### Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP)

- Doesn't use counter
- Uses the time of day in conjunction with a shared secret instead
- The code changes constantly and is only valid until the token generates the next code. 
- The token and the authentication system must have synchronized clocks for TOTP to function correctly.
- Google Authenticator soft token uses TOTP.

#### Smart Cards

- Contain embedded microchips. 

When the user authenticates with a smart card, he or she inserts it in a special reader attached to the computer. The reader then verifies the information on the chip to verify the card's authenticity. 



### 2.4 Password Authentication Protocols

#### Password Authentication Protocols (PAP)

![image-20210407234340033](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_04_PAP.PNG?raw=true)

**Major Flaw**

PAP does not use any encryption to protect this communication. Anyone able to eavesdrop on the connection can read the username and password right off the network. For this reason, **PAP should not be used, except under circumstances where the transmission is encrypted by other means**. 

#### Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

![02_04_CHAP](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_04_CHAP.PNG?raw=true)

- Secure alternative to PAP
- Authenticates the client without ever having to send the actual secret password over the network

**MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 are insecure.**



### 2.5 Single sign-on and federation

#### Federated Identity Management

- Individuals may have accounts across multiple systems
- Federated identity management systems share identity information
- This reduces the number of individual identities a user must have

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Authentication system that shares a single authentication session across multiple systems, avoiding asking users to log in multiple times

 If the organization sets the expiration period to the length of a business day, it means that users only need to logon once per day, and then their single sign-on will last the entire day. 

The higher education community has a significant need for federated identity management, because faculty and students often move between and work across institutions. A consortium of colleges and universities banded together to create an open source single sign-on system called **Shibboleth**. It is designed to work in federated situations. 

#### Trust Characteristics

- Direction (one way or two way)
- Transitivity (transitive or nontransitive)

##### One-Way Trust

- Domain 1 trusts Domain 2, but Domain 2 does not trust Domain 1

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Domain 1] --> |Trusts|B[Domain 2]
```

##### Two-Way Trust

- Domains 1 and 2 trust each other

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Domain 1] --> |Trusts|B[Domain 2]
B[Domain 2] --> |Trusts|A[Domain 1]
```

##### Transitive Trust

- If Domains 1 and 2 trust each other, and Domains 2 and 3 trust each other, then Domain 1 and 3 trust each other

##### Non-Transitive Trust

- Trust between Domains 1 and 2 and Domains 2 and 3 doe snot imply trust between Domains 1 and 3.



### 2.6 RADIUS and TACACS

One of the most common access control needs is for an organization to have a centralized approach to network and application authentication, authorization and accounting.

#### RADIUS

- Remote Access Dial-In User Service

##### RADIUS for Modem Pools

![02_05_RADIUS](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_05_RADIUS.PNG?raw=true)

A centralized RADIUS server could support modem pools located around the country, providing a single point of administration for password and account management, and consolidating accounting records in a centralized location. 

##### Successful RADIUS Authentication

![02_05_RADIUS2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_05_RADIUS2.PNG?raw=true)

RADIUS is still used today, even though dial-in modem pools are a thing of the past. Today they're used to allow many diverse applications to reply upon the same authentication source. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Remember that a *RADIUS client* is usually an application server.

In our example of a wireless network, the end user is the wireless client, but the wireless network itself is the one performing the RADIUS authentication, so the access point is the RADIUS client. 

#### RADIUS Disadvantages

- Uses unrealizable User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Does not encrypt the entire authentication sequence

#### TACACS

- Terminal Access Controller Access Control System

##### TACACS

- Developed in the 1980s using UDP

##### XTACACS

- Cisco proprietary replacement for TACACS

#### TACACS+

- Functions similarly to RADIUS
- Uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Encrypts full authentication session



### 2.7 Kerberos and LDAP

It is one of the core protocols underlying Microsoft Active Directory. 

#### Kerberos

- Ticket-based authentication system that allows users to authenticate to a centralized service and then use tickets to gain access to distributed services.

In Greek mythology, Kerberos is a dog with three heads. Kerberos is an authentication protocol for client/server applications. On most computer systems, your password is used to prove your identities; buy anyone knowing your password will effectively be you, which is no good. Therefore it is necessary to prevent anyone from eavesdropping on your password on a unsecure network. It is also necessary to provide a means of authenticating users to use any service anytime. These can be done with Kerberos, which is designed for two purposes: security and authentication.

#### Kerberos at Works

![02_07_Kerberos](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_07_Kerberos.PNG?raw=true)



Suppose a client wants to access a file server, but with Kerberos, the client must be verified through a trusted third party, Key Distribution Center (KDC). KDC includes two servers:

- Authentication Server (AS)
- Ticket Granting Server (TGS)

Step 1:

1. Client sends a request to AS, "My user ID is so and so. I need a ticket to a server." This request is partially encrypted with a secret key: his password. Keep in mind, client never sends his/her password over unsecure network, but uses it as an encryption key.
2. When AS gets the client's request, it will retrieve client's password in the data base based on userID, and use  client's password as a key to decrypt client's request. Remember, client's password is a shred secret key between AS and the client. This is how the user is verified.
3. After verifying the client, AS sends back a ticket called Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypted with another secret key.

Step 2:

1. After the client gets the encrypted TGT, the client send it to TGS, along with his request "I want to access the file server".
2. When TGS gets the TGT, it decrypts the ticket with the secret key shared with AS.
3. Then TGS issues the client a token, which is encrypted with another secret key. This third secret key is shared between TGS and the file server.
4. Then the client sends the token to the file server.

Step 3:

1. When the file server gets the token, it decrypts the token with the secret key shared with TGS.
2. The file server allows the client to use its resources for a certain period of time according to the token.

The token is like a movie ticket, with which a person can go to a theatre to enjoy a certain movie at a certain time on a certain day.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant Client
	participant AS
	participant TGS
	participant Service
	Client->>AS: My user ID is so and so. I need a ticket to a server.
	AS->>Client: TGS
	Client->>TGS: TGS + I want to access the file server
	TGS->>Client: Token (Encrypted)
	Client->>Service: Token
	Service->>Client: Allow

```

**3 Secret Keys**

- The client and AS share a secret key (client's password)

- AS and TGS share a secret key

- TGS and Sever share a secret key

![02_07_Kerberos_Keys](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_07_Kerberos_Keys.PNG?raw=true)

Kerberos is one example of using private key encryption, or symmetric key encryption

#### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

- Provides the means to query a centralized directory service, such as Microsoft Active Directory

It allows services on a network to share information about users and their authorizations in a standardized, open format. 

Active Directory uses LDAP in combination with Kerberos. While Kerberos handles authentication, LDAP provides the means to query information stored in the directory service. 

#### Ports

- Kerberos uses port 88
- LDAP uses port 389 (for unencrypted communications)
- Secure LDAP uses port 636

#### NTLM Authentication

- Was widely used on Windows systems for many years
- Depends on a hash-based challenge-response protocol (similar to CHAP)
- Has serious security vulnerabilities

#### NTLM Security Issues

##### Weak encryption

- Jeopardizes the security of encrypted hash values

##### Pass the hash

- Allows the use of credentials from one system to gain access to another system

**Avoid the use of NTLM!**



### 2.8 SAML

**SAML** The Security Assertion Markup Language allows single sign-on (SSO) within a web browser across a variety of systems.

#### SAML Authentication

- Principal: end user
- Identity Provider (IdP): end user's employer, school, or other account provider
- Service Provide (SP)

![02_08_SAML_Authentication](C:\Users\JY\Desktop\Security+\Images\04_Identity_and_Access_Management\02_08_SAML_Authentication.PNG)

#### SAML Benefits

- True SSO experience for end users
- No credential access for service provider

SP may use the IdP's authentication without gaining access to the user's password, which remains a shared secret between the user and the identity provider.



### 2.9 OAuth and OpenID Connect

The OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols provide a federated single sign-on experience for the web. 

#### OAuth Providers

- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- Google
- Amazon

#### OAuth

- **Authorization** protocol designed to work across a variety of web services

#### OpenID Connect

- Identification and **authentication** protocol designed work work with OAuth

The OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols are commonly used on the web for authentication.



### 2.10 Certificate-based authentication

**Digital certificates contain a signed copy of a user's public key.**

#### Key-Based Authentication

![02_09_Key_based_Authentication](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/04_Identity_and_Access_Management/02_09_Key_based_Authentication.PNG?raw=true)

**Key-based authentication may be automated.**

One server can connect to another using certificate-based authentication without someone entering a password.

**Certificate authorities create digital certificates for public keys used in authentication.**

#### Certificate Authentication Uses

- SSH connections
- Smart cards (CAC/PIV)
- Network access (802.1x)
