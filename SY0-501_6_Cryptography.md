# CompTIA Security+ Exam (SY0-501): Cryptography

We'll be focusing on 

- comparing and contrasting the basic concepts of cryptography
- explaining cryptographic algorithms and their basic characteristics
- installing and configuring wireless security settings
- implementing public key infrastructure



## 1. Encryption

### 1.1 Understanding Cryptography

#### Cryptography

- The use of mathematical algorithms to transform information into an encrypted form that is not readable by unauthorized individuals
- Cryptography does provide authorized individuals with the ability to transform it back to readable form through decryption

#### Encryption

- Converts information from plaintext form into encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption

- Converts ciphertext messages back into their plaintext form

#### Algorithms

- Serve as mathematical recipes

#### Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm

- **Input**: F, a temperature in Fahrenheit
- Subtract 32 from F
- Multiply the result by 5
- Divide that result by 9
- **Output**: C, the temperature in Celsius

#### Encryption Algorithms

- **Input**: P, the plaintext message
- **Input**: K, the encryption key
- Perform encryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: C, the encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption Algorithms

- **Input**: C, the ciphertext
- **Input**: K, the decryption key
- Perform decryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: P, the plaintext message



### 1.2 Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography

**Symmetric shapes have identical halves.**

#### Symmetric Algorithms (Shared Secret Algorithms )

- Encryption and decryption operations use the same key
- Larger groups require more symmetric keys
- The number of symmetric keys required: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ 

![01_01_Symmetric1](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_01_Symmetric1.PNG?raw=true)

![01_01_Symmetric2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_01_Symmetric2.PNG?raw=true)

| Group Size | Symmetric Keys |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 2          | 1              |
| 3          | 3              |
| 10         | 45             |
| 100        | 4950           |
| 1,000      | 499,500        |
| 10,000     | 49,995,000     |

 For example, if we have an organization with 10,000 employees, we'd need almost 50 million encryption keys. If a new person joins the organization, we'd need to generate 10,000 new keys for that one person to be able to communicate with the other employees in the organization. And then we'd need to distribute those 10,000 keys to every other employee in the organization.

#### Asymmetric Algorithms (Public Key Encryption Algorithms)

- Encryption and decryption operation use different keys
- use keypairs
- Anything encrypted with one key from a pair can be decrypted with the other key from that same pair
- Asymmetric cryptography is slower than symmetric, but also more scalable

##### Public Key

- Freely distributed to everyone with whom the user would like to communicate

##### Private Key

- Held in secret by the user and not disclosed to anyone else

For normal communications, the sender of the message would encrypt it with the recipient's public key, which is publicly known. The recipient would then use his or her private key to decrypt the message. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Keys used to encrypt and decrypt using asymmetric cryptography must be from the same pair!



### 1.3 Goals of Cryptography

#### Confidentiality

- Only authorized individuals can access information

#### States of Data

- Data at rest (on hard drive)
- Data in motion
- Data in use (in memory)

#### Integrity

- No unauthorized changes

#### Authentication

- Proof of identity claims

#### Nonrepudiation

- Proving the origin of a message to a third party
- Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation
- Nonrepudiation is only possible with asymmetric cryptography



### 1.4 Code and Ciphers

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Codes and ciphers are two different things!

#### Code

- A system that substitute one word or phrase for another. Codes are intended to provide secrecy and/or efficiency.
- Seemingly meaningless phrases may convey significant messages

##### "Ten" Code

Used by police and other organizations who communicate by radio. 

| Code  | Meaning                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10-4  | I acknowledge your message           |
| 10-7  | I am going out of service            |
| 10-9  | Please repeat your last transmission |
| 10-31 | There is a crime in progress         |
| 10-78 | Officer needs assistance             |

#### Ciphers

- A system that uses **mathematical algorithms** to encrypt and decrypt message

##### Stream Ciphers

- Operate on one character, or bit, of a message at a time

##### Block Ciphers

- Operate on large segments of the message at the same time

#### Substitution Ciphers (Rotation Ciphers)

- Change the characters
- Rotation ciphers, such as ROT13, simply shift the alphabet several positions to the left or right

#### Transposition Ciphers

- Rearrange the characters

**Substitution and transposition are the building blocks of modern cryptography**



### 1.5 Cryptographic Math

#### Exclusive Or (XOR)

- True when exactly one of two input values is true

| X     | Y     | X**âŠ•**Y |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE   |
| TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE    |
| FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE    |
| TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE   |

**Cryptography relies upon pseudorandom number generation because we lack a source of truly random numbers.**

#### Confusion

- Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key.

#### Diffusion

- Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits.

#### Obfuscation

- Uses cryptography to hide source code from users



### 1.6 The Perfect Encryption Algorithm

#### One-Time Pad

- It is an unbreakable encryption algorithm
- Sender and receiver have identical pads
- Key is at least as long as the message
- One-time pads are unbreakable because they are totally random

##### Example: One-Time Pad Encryption

![01_06_One_Time_Pad](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad.PNG?raw=true)

![01_06_One_Time_Pad2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad2.PNG?raw=true)

There's no repetition, so there isn't any cryptographic attack I can perform against it as long as the sender only uses the pad one time. 

**Using one time pads is very difficult.**

It's very difficult to distribute one-time pads. The sender and receiver need to be in the same room and physically hand over the pad, and then they need to meet again once they run out of pages. That's not a very efficient way to communicate.



### 1.7 Choosing Encryption Algorithms

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing.

(It's important to remember that encryption is very complicated. It uses sophisticated mathematical techniques and even the smallest flaw can render an algorithm completely insecure.)

#### Security through Obscurity

- The security of the algorithm depends upon its secrecy.

Security through obscurity is a slanderous term and not something that you'd want to hear used to describe your own approach to security. 

**Use encryption algorithms proven to be secure.**

#### Choosing Your Key Length

The more secure your information will be. There is a downside, however. As keys get longer, the performance of the algorithm goes down. You're trading off security for speed and making a classic decision that must balance security constraints with available resources. 

![01_07_Key_Length](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_07_Key_Length.PNG?raw=true)

**Use tested encryption modules and cryptographic service providers.**



### 1.8 The Cryptographic Lifecycle

**As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure.**

Either because researchers discover flaws in their implementation or because the key length used by the algorithm becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks. Therefore, it is important to have a lifecycle approach to cryptography that phases algorithms out as they become insecure.

## 2. Symmetric Cryptography

### 2.1 Data Encryption Standard (DES)

#### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- Designed by IBM in the 1970s
- Intended to serve as federal encryption standard
- Replaced untested algorithms used by agencies
- Enhance interoperability of communications

![02_01_DES](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_01_DES.png?raw=true)

- DES uses an encryption operation called the Fesitel function of 16 rounds of encryption
- Each F-box performs a combination of substitution and transposition operations
- The Feistel function repeat 16 times in a single DES encryption operation!

It takes 64 bits of plain text as input in the top and then runs it through an encryption operation known as the Feistel It uses the Feistel function 16 different times in order to produce the cipher text. 

Each of these F boxes that implements the Feistel function takes half a block of input or 32 bits and combines it with a piece of the 56-bit encryption key. 

Then the output of that function is broken up into eight segments and fed into eight different functions called S boxes, these yellow boxes labeled S1 through S8 that just appeared on the screen. S stands for Substitution and each one of these boxes contains a different substitution cipher. 

The results of all of those substitutions are then combined back together again and fed into a P box. P stands for Permutation which is just another term for transposition. So the output of all of those S boxes is scrambled up to produce the cipher text. 

**DES is no longer considered secure!**

#### Key Facts about DES

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Block cipher operating on 64-bit blocks
- Key length of 56 bits
- Now considered insecure



### 2.2 3DES

#### Triple DES

- Applied DES to plaintext 3 times with 3 keys: K1, K2, and K3

![02_02_3DES](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_02_3DES.PNG?raw=true)

#### DES Keying Options

##### Keying Option 1

- ${K1}\neq{K2}\neq{K3}$

This is the strongest approach and results an encryption with an effective key strength of 112 bits. 

##### Keying Option 2

- $K1=K3,{K1}\neq{K2},{K2}\neq{K3}$

This requires fewer keys, but reduces the strength of the algorithm from 112 bits down to 80 bits. 

##### Keying Option 3

- $K1=K2=K3$

This emulates the standard DES algorithm and is just as insecure as that standard approach. It is included for backwards compatibility with DES, but is definitely not a good option. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack.

**Triple DES is considered secure through 2030.**

when used in keying mode one. 

#### Key Facts about 3DES

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Block cipher operating on 64-bits blocks
- Effective key length of 112 bits
- Considered secure



### 2.3 AES, Blowfish, and Twofish

- The Rijndael algorithm won a competition to become the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
- AES uses substitution and transposition

It is widely used today in many different cryptographic applications ranging from web security to encrypted voice communications. 

#### Key Facts about AES

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Block cipher operating on 128-bit blocks
- Key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits
- Considered secure

#### Blowfish

- Is a public domain algorithm

### 2.4 RC4

**RC4 was a trade secret from its invention in 1987 until its public disclosure in 1994.**

#### RC4 and Network Encryption

- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)

**RC4 uses a pseudorandom keystream.**

This stream has many of the qualities of a random string, but it is not quite random because it is initialized using a selected encryption key. This makes it possible for both the sender and recipient of a message to use the same key to generate the same keystream. 

**RC4 is no longer considered secure.**

#### Key Facts about RC4

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Stream cipher
- Variable length key between 40 bits and 2,048 bits
- Not considered secure



### 2.5 Cipher Modes

**Cipher Mode** Describes how an algorithm encrypts and decrypts data

#### Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode

Perhaps the most straightforward cipher mode. The algorithm simulates a digital codebook that provides an encrypted version of each possible input. 

![02_05_ECB](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_ECB.png?raw=true)

For example, if we have a message of 192 bits that we want to encrypt, and are using a 64-bit block cipher, the algorithm breaks the message up into 3 blocks and handles each of them completely independently. It takes the first block and uses the encryption algorithm to encrypt that block with the encryption key. That creates the first ciphertext block. It then moves on to the second block and encrypts it with the same key, and then repeats the same process for the third block. 

**Encrypting the same block with the same key in ECB mode results in identical cipher text blocks.**

This is the key disadvantage of this mode, as it makes cryptoanalysis easier. CBC seeks to resolve this disadvantage by making the encryption of a block dependent upon the encryption of all previous blocks.

#### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode

CBC feeds the previous encrypted block into the encryption of the next block. 

![02_05_ECB](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_CBC.png?raw=true)

We begin in the same way as ECB mode. Breaking our plaintext into blocks. We then combine the first block with an initialization vector using the exclusive or operation. This initialization vector is just to get us started. The algorithm then uses the encryption key to encrypt the XORed combination of the plaintext and the initialization vector to get the ciphertext block. Then, when we move on to the second block, instead of using the initialization vector, we XOR the second plaintext block with the first ciphertext block and then encrypt that combination to get the second ciphertext block. We then move on to the third plaintext block, where the second encrypted block is then combined with the third plaintext block, and encrypted to get the third ciphertext block. And the process continues on, until we run out plaintext blocks. 

#### Counter Mode (CTR)

![02_05_CTR](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_CTR.png?raw=true)



It begins with a plaintext, and two values. A randomly generated value, known as a nonce. And a counter, that begins at zero, and increments during each encryption operation. The value created by the nonce and the counter is the encrypted with the encryption key, and the resulting value is XORed with the plaintext to get the cipher text. When we get to the second block, the counter value is incremented to one, and we repeat the previous operation to get the second ciphertext block. And we then do the same thing for the third block, with a counter value of two to get the final ciphertext block. 

**Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) adds authentication capability.**

Galois counter mode, or GCM, is a variant of counter mode that adds authentication to the cipher process. Supplementing the confidentiality capabilities of electronic codebook, cipher block chaining, and traditional counter mode.



### 2.6 Steganography

**Steganography** Hides data in large files

- Steganography often uses innocent-looking high-resolution images
- Slight modifications to image pixels may hide information
- Images with embedded text may be posted in plain sight

## 3. Asymmetric Cryptography

### 3.1 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

Asymmetric cryptography solves issues of scalability by giving each user a pair of keys for use in encryption and decryption operations. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Users create RSA key pairs using to large prime numbers.

**User distributes the public key freely and keeps the private key secure.**

#### RSA Keys

- Sender encrypts a message using the recipient's public key
- Recipient decrypts a message using the recipient's private key
- Usually used to transfers symmetric keys instead of long messages
- Patent is now expired

The major drawback to the RSA algorithm is that it is fairly slow. Therefore, it is not normally used for exchanging long messages directly between communicating systems. Instead, RSA is often used to create an initial secure communications channel over which two systems exchange a symmetric key. The systems can then use that symmetric key to encrypt communications for the remainder of the session.

#### Key Facts about RSA

- Asymmetric encryption algorithm
- Variable length key between 1,024 and 4,096
- Considered secure

Although there have been some published attacks against RSA, recent implementations of the algorithm are still considered secure when used with a sufficiently long key of at least 1,024 bits.



### 3.2 PGP and GnuPG

**Phil Zimmerman created Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) in 1991.**

**PGP is widely available today through the OpenPGP standard.**

#### PGP Function

- Uses public and private keys
- Combines both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

##### PGP Encryption

![03_02_PGP_Encryption](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/03_02_PGP_Encryption.PNG?raw=true)

The sender of a message has the original plain text and then generates a random symmetric encryption key. Next, the sender encrypts the message using that random symmetric key, and then encrypts the random key using the recipient's public key. The sender then transmits the encrypted message which is a combination of the encrypted data and the encrypted random key. 

##### PGP Decryption

![03_02_PGP_Decryption](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/03_02_PGP_Decryption.PNG?raw=true)

When the recipient receives the encrypted message. First, the recipient decrypts the encrypted random key using the recipient's private key. This produces the random key created by the sender. Next, the recipient uses that random key to decrypt the encrypted message and retrieve the original message.

- **PGP** Commercial product
- **GnuPG** Available for free (New Privacy Guard)

**PGP relies upon other encryption algorithms.**

One important note to remember, PGP is not an encryption algorithm itself. It is a framework for using other encryption algorithms. 



### 3.3 Elliptic Curve and Quantum Cryptography

**Asymmetric cryptography is based upon the difficulty of solving complex math problems.**

In the case of the RSA algorithm, the security of the algorithm depends upon the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. 

**Prime Number** Only divisible by themselves and 1

**Finding a way to solve the prime factorization problem efficiently would break modern cryptography!**

#### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Uses the EC discrete logarithm problem

Does not depend upon the prime factorization problem. It uses a completely different problem known as the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.

#### ! EXAM TIPS

You won't need to know the details of ECC. Remember that it doesn't use prime factorization.

#### Quantum Computing

- Uses quantum mechanics principles

It still mostly a theoretical field. But if it advances to the point where that theory becomes practical to implement, quantum cryptography may be able to defeat cryptographic algorithms that depend upon factoring large prime numbers. 

**Elliptic curve cryptography can't protect against quantum attacks.**

Elliptic curve approaches are even more susceptible to quantum attack than prime factorization algorithms.



### 3.4 Tor and Perfect Forward Secrecy

Tor is a software package that provides an anonymous, secure way for individuals to access the internet. Tor also enables access to anonymous websites that are commonly known as the dark web.

#### Tor

- The Onion Router (Tor) is a software package that uses encryption and relay nodes to facilitate anonymous Internet access

#### Tor in Action

![03_04_Tor_in_Action](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/03_04_Tor_in_Action.PNG?raw=true)

Alice's Tor browser accesses a Tor directory server and loads a list of all of the Tor nodes currently available on the internet. This is a very long list because it includes every Tor node. Each of these nodes is an individual computer system whose owner has placed it at the service of the Tor network. The owner doesn't receive any compensation for this. He or she simply wants to contribute to providing anonymized web surfing. 

Once Alice's browser has the list of nodes, it randomly selects a series of nodes, usually 3, that are used to route traffic to its final destination. Each node involved in the process only knows the identity of the node before and after it. So when Alice sends her request to node 1, node 1 knows that the request came from Alice, and it also knows that the next step in the process is to sent it to node 2, but it doesn't know that the Washington Post is the final destination. When node 2 receives the request, it knows that it came from node 1, and that it's headed next to node 3. But node 2 doesn't know Alice's identity, or the fact that the communication involves the Washington Post. When node 3 receives the message, it knows that the request came from node 2, and it knows that it needs to send the request on to the Washington Post. But node 3does not know that either Alice, or node 1was involved. 

When the request does arrive at the Washington Post server, it looks just like any other request that the website receives, but it appears to have come from node 3, and it doesn't provide Alice's identity. A server simply responds with the webpage, and sends it to node 3, thinking that it's done with the communication. However, when node 3 receives the Washington Post's response, it goes ahead and follows the circuit back, sending the reply to node 2, who sends it on to node 1, who finally sends it back to Alice. 

This preserves the anonymity of the communication, and enforces something known as perfect forward secrecy, or PFS. 

#### Perfect Forward Secrecy

- Hides nodes' identity from each other

Perfect forward secrecy uses encryption to hide the details of the communication from the participants in the communication, ensuring that each node only knows the identity of the node immediately before, and after it in the process. 

#### Request Chain

![03_04_Request_Chain1](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/03_04_Request_Chain1.PNG?raw=true)

Tor also provides the ability to have two-way anonymity, so that the user doesn't know the location of the website either. That's a function known as 'hidden sites' in Tor. 

**Not everybody likes Tor!**

Tor has its fans, but it also has its enemies. Privacy advocates praise Tor because it does allow completely anonymous activity online. Law enforcement officials do not like Tor very much, because that anonymity may be used to hide criminal activity.

## 4. Key Management

### 4.1 Key exchange

**Symmetric cryptography requires exchanging a shared secret key in advance.**

#### Symmetric Cryptography

![04_01_Symmetric](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/04_01_Symmetric.PNG?raw=true)

#### Out-of-Band Key Exchange

- Uses a different channel

- Face-to-face meeting
- Physical mail
- Telephone call

**Out-of-band key exchange is difficult and time consuming.**

Alice and Bob might be separated by a great distance, making a physical meeting impractical. Sending a letter by physical mail takes a few days and attempting to read a lengthy encryption key over the phone is very difficult. 

#### In-Band Key Exchange

- Securely exchange keys digitally



### 4.2 Diffie-Hellman

**Ralph Merkle's work formed the basis of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.**

**Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman created the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHE) algorithm**

#### Diffie-Hellman Example

![04_02_Diffie_Hellman](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/04_02_Diffie_Hellman.PNG?raw=true)

Now, let's say that Mal was watching all of the messages that Alice and Bob exchanged. She'd know that they started with the color yellow and she'd know that they exchanged the colors green and orange. She would not know either of the two secret colors that Alice and Bob selected, red and blue, or the common secret color brown because those were never sent over email. 

![04_02_Diffie_Hellman2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/04_02_Diffie_Hellman2.PNG?raw=true)

- $p$ must be a prime number
- $A=g^{a}mod(p)$
- $B=g^{b}mode(p)$
- $S=B^{a}mod(p)$
- $S=A^{b}mod(p)$

If Mal watched the entire communication between Alice and Bob, she wouldn't have enough information to reconstruct that key, just like she couldn't figure out that the shared secret color in the earlier example was brown. 

**$p$ and $g$ must be large values to achieve strong security.**

#### Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDHE)

- Uses elliptic curve problem

ECDH uses a similar approach, but replaces the prime factorization difficulty with complexity drawn from the elliptic curve problem that I discussed earlier in the course. 

#### Diffie-Hellman Groups

| Group Number | Description                      | Security                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1            | 768-bit group                    | <font color=red>INSECURE</font> |
| 2            | 1024-bit group                   | <font color=red>INSECURE</font> |
| 5            | 1536-bit group                   | <font color=red>INSECURE</font> |
| 14           | 2048-bit group                   | SECURE                          |
| 19           | 3072-bit group                   | SECURE                          |
| 20           | 384-bit elliptic curve group     | SECURE                          |
| 21           | 521-bit elliptic curve group     | SECURE                          |
| 24           | 2048-bit group, 256-bit subgroup | SECURE                          |

Diffie-Hellman algorithms use the concept of groups to describe key strength. There are two important things that you need to know

1. The higher the group number, the more secure the use of Diffie-Hellman and second
2. Group 14 is the lowest numbered group that is considered secure. You should not use Diffie-Hellman groups with numbers under 14.



### 4.3 Key Escrow

Strong encryption is very difficult to defeat, and this causes a problem for law enforcement and other government agencies, who feel that they have a right to access encrypted communications under certain circumstances, such as when they obtain a search warrant. That's where the concept of key escrow comes into play. 

#### Encryption Key Escrow

- Allows government access to keys

In this case, government officials have proposed key escrow technologies that would provide law enforcement with access to encrypted information. The idea is that government agents would have to obtain a court order before accessing escrowed keys, thus protecting the privacy of other individuals. 

While this may be a reasonable goal, there is not yet a reasonable way to implement this approach in a secure manner. 

- The Clipper chip included technology that would allow government access to encrypted communications
- Privacy advocates and industry firms fought strongly against the Clipper chip

The Clipper chip caused a tremendous public controversy, as groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined forces with security firms like RSA, to campaign publicly against the Clipper chip's government back door. 

After further analysis of the Clipper chip's algorithm, security researchers discovered that it contained fundamental flaws, that would have prevented its secure use in the first place. 

We're left in a difficult situation, with two competing interests. The government has a legitimate need to access information, when they have a legitimately issued warrant. On the other hand, consumers expect technology companies to build secure products that keep out all kinds of unwanted intruders. 

#### Recovery Agents

- Allow internal access to lost keys

The recover agent possesses a master encryption key that may decrypt any information used by the organization. That key must be protected carefully, as it allows global access to all encrypted data in the organization.



### 4.4 Key Stretching

Many encryption technologies depend upon the ability to create an encryption key from a password in a way that remains strong. Key stretching technologies allow this to happen. 

#### Key Stretching

- Takes a relatively insecure value, such as a password, and uses mathematical techniques to strengthen it, making it harder to crack

##### Salting

- Adds a value to the encryption key to make it more complex

##### Hashing

- Adds time to the verification process by requiring more math

This might be less than a second, but key stretching algorithms repeat this process hundreds or thousands of times to consume longer amounts of time. 

**Verifying one key is fast, but guessing millions of keys is slow!**

#### PBKDF2

- Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2
- Uses salting and hashing to stretch a key
- Should be used at least 4,000 times

#### Bcrypt

- Key stretching with Blowfish

It's based upon the Blowfish cipher and uses that algorithm's hashing approach combined with a salt to strengthen keys.

4. Bcrypt




## 5. Public Key Infrastructure

### 5.1 Trust Models

#### Requirements for Key Exchange

- The two parties must be confident that they are really communicating with each other and neither one is an imposter
- The two parties must be confident that nobody is eavesdropping on the key exchange

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol helps us with preventing eavesdropping, but we still require some way to ensure that we're not communicating with an imposter.

#### Asymmetric Cryptography

- Users don't need to share their private keys.
- Users can and should share their public key freely.
- Eavesdropping protection isn't needed during the key exchange.
- We still need to prevent imposters!

#### Trust Models

- Personal knowledge: cumbersome and difficult
- Web of Trust (WOT)
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

#### Web of Trust

- Relies on indirect relationships
- Participants digitally sign the public keys of people they know personally

The Web of Trust recognizes that it simply isn't possible for you to personally meet everyone that you want to exchange messages with. While you might not know the person you wish to communicate with personally, you might know somebody who knows that person. Or perhaps you have a third-level connection where you know somebody who knows somebody who knows that person. 

The Web of Trust takes advantage of this by using digital signatures to vouch for the public keys of individuals. Every participant signs the public keys of everyone they know when they verify that the public key belongs to that person. And then everyone in the system builds a list of the people they trust to vouch for others. 

If this web becomes large enough, there is a reasonable expectation that indirect trust relationships will allow most people to communicate with most other people. 

#### WOT Issues

- Decentralized approach: difficult to manage
- High barrier to entry
- Requires technical knowledge

For these reasons, the Web of Trust never really took off outside of the technical community. 

**PKI builds upon the web of trust.**

but introduces centralized authorities who can make the process easier. 



### 5.2 PKI and Digital Certificates

**PKI depends upon trusted certificate authorities (CAs)**

instead of relying upon the peer-to-peer trust relationships

#### Certificate Authorities (CAs)

- Certificate authorities are trusted third-party organizations who verify the identity of individuals or organizations and then issue digital certificates containing both identity information and a copy the the subject's public key.

The process is fairly similar to the one we use to issue government identification cards in the physical world. 

1. The DMV asks you to prove your identity by providing multiple forms of identification
2. After you prove your identity, the DMV issues you a certificate that allow you to prove your identity to third party

- Digital certificates are the identity cards of the digital world.
- After authenticating identity, the CA provides a digital certificate containing the public key.
- Anyone receiving your digital certificate can verify its authenticity by checking the digital signature of the issuing CA.
- Anyone trying to use your digital certificate illegitimately won't have your private key.

That actually could happen very easily because your certificate is meant to be shared widely. It's not a problem however because the only thing that someone could do with that certificate is encrypt a message with your public key. As long as you keep your private key secret, the person who stole your digital certificate wouldn't be able to decrypt the message encrypted using that certificate so there isn't any loss of confidentiality. 



### 5.3 Hash Functions

#### Hash Functions

- Hash Functions are one-way functions that transform a variable length input into a unique, fixed-length output

**One-way functions can't be reversed.**

**The output of a hash function will always be the same length, regardless of the input size.**

**No two inputs to a hash function should produce the same ouput.**

#### Hash Functions May Fail

1. If they are reversible
2. If they are not collision resistant (it makes it possible to forge digital signatures and digital certificates.)

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Know which hash functions are considered insecure and which remain secure today

#### Message Digest 5 (MD5)

- Ron Rivest created MD5 in 1991.
- MD5 is the fifth in a series of hash functions.
- Message digest is another term for hash.
- MD5 produces 128-bit hashes.
- MD5 is no longer secure.

In 2013, three cryptanalysts discovered a technique that breaks MD5's collision resistance in less than a second on a store-bought computer. Therefore, MD5 is no longer considered secure and should not be used. However, many systems still rely upon MD5 for secure applications. That is a very bad idea. 

#### Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

- NIST created the SHA family as a government standard.

##### SHA-1

- Produces a 160-bit hash value
- Contains security flaws that render it insecure

##### SHA-2

- Consists of a family of six hash functions
- Produces output of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits
- Uses a mathematically similar approach to SHA-1 and MD5

All the SHA-2 algorithms are mathematically similar to both SHA-1 and MD5, and are theoretically susceptible to the same flaws that broke those algorithms. However, there is no known attack against SHA-2 today, so it is still safe for use.

##### SHA-3

- Designed as an eventual replacement for SHA-2
- Uses a completely different hash generation approach than SHA-2
- Produces hash of user-selected fixed length

Some academic researchers do not trust the SHA algorithms because of their origins within the US government, and specifically the involvement of the National Security Agency in the creation of the SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms. 

#### RIPEMD

- Primitive Evaluation Message Digest
- Created as an alternative to government-sponsored hash functions
- Produces 128, 160, 256, and 320-bit hashes
- Contains flaws in the 128-bit version

But the 160-bit version of RIPEMD is widely used today.

There's no concept of similarity, it's either exactly right or completely wrong. That's part of the beauty and part of the challenge of working with hash functions. 

#### HMAC

- Hash-Based Message Authentication Code
- Combines symmetric cryptography and hashing
- Provides authentication and integrity
- Create and verify message authentication code by using a secret key in conjunction with a hash function

**Hash functions are used with asymmetric cryptography for digital signatures and digital certificates.**



### 5.4 Digital Signatures

**Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to achieve integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.**

#### What Signed Message Recipients Know

1. The owner of the public key is the person who signed the message -> Authentication
2. The message was not altered after being signed -> Integrity
3. The recipient can prove these facts to a third party -> Non-repudiation

#### What Digital Signatures Depend On

1. Collison=resistant hash functions
2. Asymmetric cryptography

**Use private keys to create digital signatures**

#### Digital Signature Example

![05_04_Digital_Signature](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/05_04_Digital_Signature.png?raw=true)

**Digitally signing the messages does not provide confidentiality.**

In this example, anyone could read the message, not just Bob. If Alice wanted to be sure that only Bob could read the message, she could take the added step of encrypting the message with Bob's public key.



### 5.5 Digital Signatures Standard

The Digital Signature Standard is a US Federal government standard for appropriate digital signature algorithms. The standard is published by the National Institute for Standards in Technologist (NIST) and the current version of the standard came out in 2013. It's published as a Federal Information Processing Standard or FIPS number 186-4.

#### Approved DSS Algorithms

- Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
- Rivest, Shamir, Adelman (RSA)
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

The Digital Signature Standard endorses the uses of RSA for digital signatures that are described in American National Standard X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standard, or PKCS number one. 

The Digital Signature Standard endorses the use of ECDSA for digital signatures as described in American National Standard X9.62. 



### 5.6 Create a Digital Certificate

**Digital certificates use the X.509 standard.**

Therefore, you might hear digital certificates referred to as X.509 certificates.

#### Creating a Digital Certificate

![05_06_Create_Digital_Certificate](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/05_06_Create_Digital_Certificate.PNG?raw=true)

1. Alice creates a public private key pair for the encryption algorithm of her choice. 
2. She then creates a message called a certificate signing request, or CSR, which contains Alice's public key as well as Alice's name and other identifying information such as an email address or a server name. Alice then sends the CSR to the CA of her choice. 
3. This might be an independent organization that is trusted by many people around the world, or it may be a private certificate authority operated for use within her organization. If the CA is a third party, it is also known as the registration authority, or RA. 
4. When the CA receives the CSR, it first takes whatever action is necessary to validate the identity of the requester. 
5. Once the CA is satisfied that the sender is legitimate, it removes the public key from the certificate signing request and places it in the format of an X.509 certificate. 
6. The CA then uses it's private key to place the CA's digital signature on the digital certificate and sends the certificate back to the requester. 
7. The requester may then use that certificate and provide it to anyone who wishes to communicate with them. 
8. A third party wishing to communicate with Alice can then verify that the certificate is valid by simply checking that the CA's digital signature on the certificate is valid. If the signature is correct, the third parties know that they can use the public key contained in the certificate to communicate with the person named on the certificate, Alice. 



### 5.7 Revoke a Digital Certificate

The security of digital certificates depends upon the security of the private key associated with that certificate. If the certificate owner's private key is compromised, the owner needs a way to revoke the digital certificate so that it can't be used to impersonate the owner later on. 

#### Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

- CAs provide a list of the serial numbers of revoked certificates

Anyone accessing a digital certificate is responsible for download the CRL and verifying that the serial number is not included on that list before relying upon the public key contained within the certificate. This approach was inefficient because it often had time delays and consumed a lot of network bandwidth as everyone on the internet attempted to download CRLs everyday from every certificate authority and the lists themselves grew longer. 

#### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

- CAs provide a real-time service that allows users to verify that a certificate is not revoked.

**Most modern browsers implement OCSP.**

One exception to this is Google Chrome, which uses Google's own proprietary approach for verifying certificates.



### 5.8 Certificate Stapling

Certificate stapling is an extension to the Online Certificate Status Protocol that relieves some of the burden placed upon certificate authorities by the original protocol. 

**OCSP places a significant burden on the OCSP servers operated by certificate authorities (CAs).**

#### Certificate Stapling

- Reduces the CA's burden

#### Standard OCSP

![05_08_OCSP](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/05_08_OCSP.PNG?raw=true)

When a user visits a website and initiates a secure connection, the website sends its certificate to the **end user** who would normally then be responsible for contacting the OCSP server to verify the certificate's validity. 

#### OCSP Certificate Stapling

![05_08_OCSP_Stapling](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/05_08_OCSP_Stapling.PNG?raw=true)

With certificate stapling the **web server** contacts the OCSP server itself and receives a signed and time stamped response from the OCSP server, which it then attaches or staples to the digital certificate. 

When the web server receives a request from an end user, it then sends that user the certificate with the stapled OCSP response. The user's browser then verifies that the certificate is authentic and also validates that the stapled OCSP response is genuine and recent. 

That might sound like it's just as much a burden on the CA's server as if the user requested the validation, and it is. The savings come when the next user visits the website. The web server can simply reuse the stapled certificate without recontacting the OCSP server. As long as the time stamp is recent enough the user will accept the stapled certificate without needing to contact the CA's OCSP server again. 

It's common to have stapled certificates with a validity period of 24 hours. That reduces the burden on the OCSP server from handling one request per user over the course of a day, which could be millions of requests, down to handling one request per certificate per day. That's a tremendous reduction. 



### 5.9 Certificate Authorities

#### Obtaining a Digital Certificate

- Users verify the digital certificate's authenticity using the CA's public key

![05_09_Obtain_Digital_Signature](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/05_09_Obtain_Digital_Signature.PNG?raw=true)

n most cases, organizations choose to use a well-know certificate authority because the vast majority of users around the world will already be configured to trust that certificate authority.

**You must pay a fee to the CA to obtain a trusted certificate.**

Because of this, organizations sometimes take steps to reduce the number of certificates that they purchase. 

#### Self-Signed Certificates

- Issued by an internal CA

In this approach, an organization sets up its own certificate authority and then uses it to generate its own certificates. These certificates aren't trusted by the outside world because they're not signed by a trusted certificate authority, but they can be used for internal purposes. Large organizations often setup their own CAs and then configure systems throughout the organization to trust the internal CA. They can then use this internal CA to issue their own certificates for free for internal websites and other uses. 

Some organizations go a step further and have their own internal CA trusted by a third-party CA using a technique known as certificate chaining. 

**Certificate chaining allows the use of intermediate CAs.**

This allows the organization to issue their own certificates that are then trusted by external users because the CA that issued them, the organization's CA, is trusted by a third-party CA. That's the chain of trust. In this case, the internal CA is known as an intermediate CA. 

#### Offline CAs

- Protect sensitive root keys

Another reason to use certificate chaining is to allow the use of offline certificate authorities. The root certificate of a CA is a very sensitive object. Therefore, the private key associated with a certificate is normally not kept on a system that is connected to a network. Instead, it is stored in an offline CA that is only used to sign the certificates of online intermediate CAs belonging to the same organization. These online CAs are then used to actually issue certificates to customers. This way the root certificate is carefully safeguarded and only used occasionally to certify a new online CA. 



### 5.10 Certificate Subjects

The most common use of certificates is to protect web servers, but certificates can also provide protection for other servers, individuals, and email addresses. 

#### Certificate Subject

- Owner of the public key

#### ! EXAM TIPS

You may find exam questions that discuss certificate object identifiers (OIDs)

#### Certificate Subjects

- **Servers** (web, SSH, file, or any other server requiring trusting connections.)
- **Device** (SANs, routers, switches, VPNs, access points, etc..)
- **Individuals** (names, email addresses)

There are some attacks against certificates that involve creating a false certificate for a site. There's one more security feature that organizations can use to protect their certificates against fraud. 

#### Certificate Pinning

- Ties a certificate to a subject for period of time

Certificate pinning is a technology that tells users of certificates that they should not expect a certificate to change over time. When a user receives a certificate from a certificate subject, they're also told to remember or pin that certificate for an extended period and report any changes to the certificate as a potential security issue.



### 5.11 Certificate Types

#### Root Certificates

- Protect CA private keys

These are the core certificates at the heart of a certificate authority, and are used as the very first certificate or the root of trust in chain certificates. 

#### Wildcard Certificates

- Match an entire domain
- Commonly used for load balancers (and other devices that must match many different domain names.)

Because of this, they also must be carefully secured. 

**Wildcard Certificate Example**

- *.linkedin.com
  - www.linkedin.com
  - mail.linkedin.com
  - secure.linkedin.com
- **Wildcard certificates match only one level deep**

Using a wildcard certificate allows the device to impersonate all of the relevant sub-domains without administrators having to obtain and install individual certificates for each sub-domain. 

**CAs issuing certificates are vouching for the certificate subject's identity.**

#### Domain Validation (DV)

- Verify domain ownership

The lowest level of trust. 

#### Organizational Validation (OV)

- Verify business name

The CA verifies not only that the certificate's subject owns the domain, but also that the name of the organization purchasing the certificate is valid. 

#### Extended Validation (EV)

- Require extensive investigation

The highest level of trust. After receiving documentation from the certificate subject, before issuing an EV certificate, the CA performs an extensive investigation to verify the physical existence and legitimacy of the organization.

### 5.12 Certificate Formats

#### Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)

- Binary format
- Use. DER, .CRT, and .CER file extensions

#### PEM Certificates

- Name comes from outdated Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) standard
- ASCII text equivalents of DER certificates
