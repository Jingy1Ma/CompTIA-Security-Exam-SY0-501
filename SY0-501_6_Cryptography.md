# CompTIA Security+ Exam (SY0-501): Cryptography

We'll be focusing on 

- comparing and contrasting the basic concepts of cryptography
- explaining cryptographic algorithms and their basic characteristics
- installing and configuring wireless security settings
- implementing public key infrastructure



## 1. Encryption

### 1.1 Understanding Cryptography

#### Cryptography

- The use of mathematical algorithms to transform information into an encrypted form that is not readable by unauthorized individuals
- Cryptography does provide authorized individuals with the ability to transform it back to readable form through decryption

#### Encryption

- Converts information from plaintext form into encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption

- Converts ciphertext messages back into their plaintext form

#### Algorithms

- Serve as mathematical recipes

#### Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm

- **Input**: F, a temperature in Fahrenheit
- Subtract 32 from F
- Multiply the result by 5
- Divide that result by 9
- **Output**: C, the temperature in Celsius

#### Encryption Algorithms

- **Input**: P, the plaintext message
- **Input**: K, the encryption key
- Perform encryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: C, the encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption Algorithms

- **Input**: C, the ciphertext
- **Input**: K, the decryption key
- Perform decryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: P, the plaintext message



### 1.2 Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography

**Symmetric shapes have identical halves.**

#### Symmetric Algorithms (Shared Secret Algorithms )

- Encryption and decryption operations use the same key
- Larger groups require more symmetric keys
- The number of symmetric keys required: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

![01_01_Symmetric2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_01_Symmetric2.PNG?raw=true)

| Group Size | Symmetric Keys |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 2          | 1              |
| 3          | 3              |
| 10         | 45             |
| 100        | 4950           |
| 1,000      | 499,500        |
| 10,000     | 49,995,000     |

 For example, if we have an organization with 10,000 employees, we'd need almost 50 million encryption keys. If a new person joins the organization, we'd need to generate 10,000 new keys for that one person to be able to communicate with the other employees in the organization. And then we'd need to distribute those 10,000 keys to every other employee in the organization.

#### Asymmetric Algorithms (Public Key Encryption Algorithms)

- Encryption and decryption operation use different keys
- use keypairs
- Anything encrypted with one key from a pair can be decrypted with the other key from that same pair
- Asymmetric cryptography is slower than symmetric, but also more scalable

##### Public Key

- Freely distributed to everyone with whom the user would like to communicate

##### Private Key

- Held in secret by the user and not disclosed to anyone else

For normal communications, the sender of the message would encrypt it with the recipient's public key, which is publicly known. The recipient would then use his or her private key to decrypt the message. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Keys used to encrypt and decrypt using asymmetric cryptography must be from the same pair!



### 1.3 Goals of Cryptography

#### Confidentiality

- Only authorized individuals can access information

#### States of Data

- Data at rest (on hard drive)
- Data in motion
- Data in use (in memory)

#### Integrity

- No unauthorized changes

#### Authentication

- Proof of identity claims

#### Nonrepudiation

- Proving the origin of a message to a third party
- Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation
- Nonrepudiation is only possible with asymmetric cryptography



### 1.4 Code and Ciphers

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Codes and ciphers are two different things!

#### Code

- A system that substitute one word or phrase for another. Codes are intended to provide secrecy and/or efficiency.
- Seemingly meaningless phrases may convey significant messages

##### "Ten" Code

Used by police and other organizations who communicate by radio. 

| Code  | Meaning                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10-4  | I acknowledge your message           |
| 10-7  | I am going out of service            |
| 10-9  | Please repeat your last transmission |
| 10-31 | There is a crime in progress         |
| 10-78 | Officer needs assistance             |

#### Ciphers

- A system that uses **mathematical algorithms** to encrypt and decrypt message

##### Stream Ciphers

- Operate on one character, or bit, of a message at a time

##### Block Ciphers

- Operate on large segments of the message at the same time

#### Substitution Ciphers (Rotation Ciphers)

- Change the characters
- Rotation ciphers, such as ROT13, simply shift the alphabet several positions to the left or right

#### Transposition Ciphers

- Rearrange the characters

**Substitution and transposition are the building blocks of modern cryptography**



### 1.5 Cryptographic Math

#### Exclusive Or (XOR)

- True when exactly one of two input values is true

| X     | Y     | X**âŠ•**Y |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE   |
| TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE    |
| FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE    |
| TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE   |

**Cryptography relies upon pseudorandom number generation because we lack a source of truly random numbers.**

#### Confusion

- Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key.

#### Diffusion

- Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits.

#### Obfuscation

- Uses cryptography to hide source code from users



### 1.6 The Perfect Encryption Algorithm

#### One-Time Pad

- It is an unbreakable encryption algorithm
- Sender and receiver have identical pads
- Key is at least as long as the message
- One-time pads are unbreakable because they are totally random

##### Example: One-Time Pad Encryption

![01_06_One_Time_Pad](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad.PNG?raw=true)

![01_06_One_Time_Pad2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad2.PNG?raw=true)

There's no repetition, so there isn't any cryptographic attack I can perform against it as long as the sender only uses the pad one time. 

**Using one time pads is very difficult.**

It's very difficult to distribute one-time pads. The sender and receiver need to be in the same room and physically hand over the pad, and then they need to meet again once they run out of pages. That's not a very efficient way to communicate.



### 1.7 Choosing Encryption Algorithms

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing.

(It's important to remember that encryption is very complicated. It uses sophisticated mathematical techniques and even the smallest flaw can render an algorithm completely insecure.)

#### Security through Obscurity

- The security of the algorithm depends upon its secrecy.

Security through obscurity is a slanderous term and not something that you'd want to hear used to describe your own approach to security. 

**Use encryption algorithms proven to be secure.**

#### Choosing Your Key Length

The more secure your information will be. There is a downside, however. As keys get longer, the performance of the algorithm goes down. You're trading off security for speed and making a classic decision that must balance security constraints with available resources. 

![01_07_Key_Length](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_07_Key_Length.PNG?raw=true)

**Use tested encryption modules and cryptographic service providers.**



### 1.8 The Cryptographic Lifecycle

**As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure.**

Either because researchers discover flaws in their implementation or because the key length used by the algorithm becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks. Therefore, it is important to have a lifecycle approach to cryptography that phases algorithms out as they become insecure.

## 2. Symmetric Cryptography

### 2.1 Data Encryption Standard (DES)

#### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- Designed by IBM in the 1970s
- Intended to serve as federal encryption standard
- Replaced untested algorithms used by agencies
- Enhance interoperability of communications

![02_01_DES](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_01_DES.png?raw=true)

- DES uses an encryption operation called the Fesitel function of 16 rounds of encryption
- Each F-box performs a combination of substitution and transposition operations
- The Feistel function repeat 16 times in a single DES encryption operation!

It takes 64 bits of plain text as input in the top and then runs it through an encryption operation known as the Feistel It uses the Feistel function 16 different times in order to produce the cipher text. 

Each of these F boxes that implements the Feistel function takes half a block of input or 32 bits and combines it with a piece of the 56-bit encryption key. 

Then the output of that function is broken up into eight segments and fed into eight different functions called S boxes, these yellow boxes labeled S1 through S8 that just appeared on the screen. S stands for Substitution and each one of these boxes contains a different substitution cipher. 

The results of all of those substitutions are then combined back together again and fed into a P box. P stands for Permutation which is just another term for transposition. So the output of all of those S boxes is scrambled up to produce the cipher text. 

**DES is no longer considered secure!**

#### Key Facts about DES

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Block cipher operating on 64-bit blocks
- Key length of 56 bits
- Now considered insecure



### 2.2 3DES

#### Triple DES

- Applied DES to plaintext 3 times with 3 keys: K1, K2, and K3

![02_02_3DES](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_02_3DES.PNG?raw=true)

#### DES Keying Options

##### Keying Option 1

- ${K1}\neq{K2}\neq{K3}$

This is the strongest approach and results an encryption with an effective key strength of 112 bits. 

##### Keying Option 2

- $K1=K3,{K1}\neq{K2},{K2}\neq{K3}$

This requires fewer keys, but reduces the strength of the algorithm from 112 bits down to 80 bits. 

##### Keying Option 3

- $K1=K2=K3$

This emulates the standard DES algorithm and is just as insecure as that standard approach. It is included for backwards compatibility with DES, but is definitely not a good option. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack.

**Triple DES is considered secure through 2030.**

when used in keying mode one.

#### RC4 and Network Encryption

- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)

**RC4 uses a pseudorandom keystream.**

This stream has many of the qualities of a random string, but it is not quite random because it is initialized using a selected encryption key. This makes it possible for both the sender and recipient of a message to use the same key to generate the same keystream. 

**RC4 is no longer considered secure.**

#### Key Facts about RC4

- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Stream cipher
- Variable length key between 40 bits and 2,048 bits
- Not considered secure



### 2.5 Cipher Modes

**Cipher Mode** Describes how an algorithm encrypts and decrypts data

#### Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode

Perhaps the most straightforward cipher mode. The algorithm simulates a digital codebook that provides an encrypted version of each possible input. 

![02_05_ECB](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_ECB.png?raw=true)

For example, if we have a message of 192 bits that we want to encrypt, and are using a 64-bit block cipher, the algorithm breaks the message up into 3 blocks and handles each of them completely independently. It takes the first block and uses the encryption algorithm to encrypt that block with the encryption key. That creates the first ciphertext block. It then moves on to the second block and encrypts it with the same key, and then repeats the same process for the third block. 

**Encrypting the same block with the same key in ECB mode results in identical cipher text blocks.**

This is the key disadvantage of this mode, as it makes cryptoanalysis easier. CBC seeks to resolve this disadvantage by making the encryption of a block dependent upon the encryption of all previous blocks.

#### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode

CBC feeds the previous encrypted block into the encryption of the next block. 

![02_05_ECB](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_CBC.png?raw=true)

We begin in the same way as ECB mode. Breaking our plaintext into blocks. We then combine the first block with an initialization vector using the exclusive or operation. This initialization vector is just to get us started. The algorithm then uses the encryption key to encrypt the XORed combination of the plaintext and the initialization vector to get the ciphertext block. Then, when we move on to the second block, instead of using the initialization vector, we XOR the second plaintext block with the first ciphertext block and then encrypt that combination to get the second ciphertext block. We then move on to the third plaintext block, where the second encrypted block is then combined with the third plaintext block, and encrypted to get the third ciphertext block. And the process continues on, until we run out plaintext blocks. 

#### Counter Mode (CTR)

![02_05_CTR](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/02_05_CTR.png?raw=true)



It begins with a plaintext, and two values. A randomly generated value, known as a nonce. And a counter, that begins at zero, and increments during each encryption operation. The value created by the nonce and the counter is the encrypted with the encryption key, and the resulting value is XORed with the plaintext to get the cipher text. When we get to the second block, the counter value is incremented to one, and we repeat the previous operation to get the second ciphertext block. And we then do the same thing for the third block, with a counter value of two to get the final ciphertext block. 

**Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) adds authentication capability.**

Galois counter mode, or GCM, is a variant of counter mode that adds authentication to the cipher process. Supplementing the confidentiality capabilities of electronic codebook, cipher block chaining, and traditional counter mode.



### 2.6 Steganography

**Steganography** Hides data in large files

- Steganography often uses innocent-looking high-resolution images
- Slight modifications to image pixels may hide information
- Images with embedded text may be posted in plain sight
