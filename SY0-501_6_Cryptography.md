# CompTIA Security+ Exam (SY0-501): Cryptography

We'll be focusing on 

- comparing and contrasting the basic concepts of cryptography
- explaining cryptographic algorithms and their basic characteristics
- installing and configuring wireless security settings
- implementing public key infrastructure



## 1. Encryption

### 1.1 Understanding Cryptography

#### Cryptography

- The use of mathematical algorithms to transform information into an encrypted form that is not readable by unauthorized individuals
- Cryptography does provide authorized individuals with the ability to transform it back to readable form through decryption

#### Encryption

- Converts information from plaintext form into encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption

- Converts ciphertext messages back into their plaintext form

#### Algorithms

- Serve as mathematical recipes

#### Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm

- **Input**: F, a temperature in Fahrenheit
- Subtract 32 from F
- Multiply the result by 5
- Divide that result by 9
- **Output**: C, the temperature in Celsius

#### Encryption Algorithms

- **Input**: P, the plaintext message
- **Input**: K, the encryption key
- Perform encryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: C, the encrypted ciphertext

#### Decryption Algorithms

- **Input**: C, the ciphertext
- **Input**: K, the decryption key
- Perform decryption steps using P and K
- **Output**: P, the plaintext message



### 1.2 Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography

**Symmetric shapes have identical halves.**

#### Symmetric Algorithms (Shared Secret Algorithms )

- Encryption and decryption operations use the same key
- Larger groups require more symmetric keys
- The number of symmetric keys required: $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

| Group Size | Symmetric Keys |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 2          | 1              |
| 3          | 3              |
| 10         | 45             |
| 100        | 4950           |
| 1,000      | 499,500        |
| 10,000     | 49,995,000     |

 For example, if we have an organization with 10,000 employees, we'd need almost 50 million encryption keys. If a new person joins the organization, we'd need to generate 10,000 new keys for that one person to be able to communicate with the other employees in the organization. And then we'd need to distribute those 10,000 keys to every other employee in the organization.

#### Asymmetric Algorithms (Public Key Encryption Algorithms)

- Encryption and decryption operation use different keys
- use keypairs
- Anything encrypted with one key from a pair can be decrypted with the other key from that same pair
- Asymmetric cryptography is slower than symmetric, but also more scalable

##### Public Key

- Freely distributed to everyone with whom the user would like to communicate

##### Private Key

- Held in secret by the user and not disclosed to anyone else

For normal communications, the sender of the message would encrypt it with the recipient's public key, which is publicly known. The recipient would then use his or her private key to decrypt the message. 

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Keys used to encrypt and decrypt using asymmetric cryptography must be from the same pair!



### 1.3 Goals of Cryptography

#### Confidentiality

- Only authorized individuals can access information

#### States of Data

- Data at rest (on hard drive)
- Data in motion
- Data in use (in memory)

#### Integrity

- No unauthorized changes

#### Authentication

- Proof of identity claims

#### Nonrepudiation

- Proving the origin of a message to a third party
- Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation
- Nonrepudiation is only possible with asymmetric cryptography



### 1.4 Code and Ciphers

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Codes and ciphers are two different things!

#### Code

- A system that substitute one word or phrase for another. Codes are intended to provide secrecy and/or efficiency.
- Seemingly meaningless phrases may convey significant messages

##### "Ten" Code

Used by police and other organizations who communicate by radio. 

| Code  | Meaning                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10-4  | I acknowledge your message           |
| 10-7  | I am going out of service            |
| 10-9  | Please repeat your last transmission |
| 10-31 | There is a crime in progress         |
| 10-78 | Officer needs assistance             |

#### Ciphers

- A system that uses **mathematical algorithms** to encrypt and decrypt message

##### Stream Ciphers

- Operate on one character, or bit, of a message at a time

##### Block Ciphers

- Operate on large segments of the message at the same time

#### Substitution Ciphers (Rotation Ciphers)

- Change the characters
- Rotation ciphers, such as ROT13, simply shift the alphabet several positions to the left or right

#### Transposition Ciphers

- Rearrange the characters

**Substitution and transposition are the building blocks of modern cryptography**



### 1.5 Cryptographic Math

#### Exclusive Or (XOR)

- True when exactly one of two input values is true

| X     | Y     | X**âŠ•**Y |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE   |
| TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE    |
| FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE    |
| TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE   |

**Cryptography relies upon pseudorandom number generation because we lack a source of truly random numbers.**

#### Confusion

- Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key.

#### Diffusion

- Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits.

#### Obfuscation

- Uses cryptography to hide source code from users



### 1.6 The Perfect Encryption Algorithm

#### One-Time Pad

- It is an unbreakable encryption algorithm
- Sender and receiver have identical pads
- Key is at least as long as the message
- One-time pads are unbreakable because they are totally random

##### Example: One-Time Pad Encryption

![01_06_One_Time_Pad](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad.PNG?raw=true)

![01_06_One_Time_Pad2](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_06_One_Time_Pad2.PNG?raw=true)

There's no repetition, so there isn't any cryptographic attack I can perform against it as long as the sender only uses the pad one time. 

**Using one time pads is very difficult.**

It's very difficult to distribute one-time pads. The sender and receiver need to be in the same room and physically hand over the pad, and then they need to meet again once they run out of pages. That's not a very efficient way to communicate.



### 1.7 Choosing Encryption Algorithms

#### ! EXAM TIPS

Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing.

(It's important to remember that encryption is very complicated. It uses sophisticated mathematical techniques and even the smallest flaw can render an algorithm completely insecure.)

#### Security through Obscurity

- The security of the algorithm depends upon its secrecy.

Security through obscurity is a slanderous term and not something that you'd want to hear used to describe your own approach to security. 

**Use encryption algorithms proven to be secure.**

#### Choosing Your Key Length

The more secure your information will be. There is a downside, however. As keys get longer, the performance of the algorithm goes down. You're trading off security for speed and making a classic decision that must balance security constraints with available resources. 

![01_07_Key_Length](https://github.com/Jingy1Ma/CompTIA-Security-Exam-SY0-501/blob/main/Images/06_Cryptography/01_07_Key_Length.PNG?raw=true)

**Use tested encryption modules and cryptographic service providers.**



### 1.8 The Cryptographic Lifecycle

**As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure.**

Either because researchers discover flaws in their implementation or because the key length used by the algorithm becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks. Therefore, it is important to have a lifecycle approach to cryptography that phases algorithms out as they become insecure. 

#### NIST's Cryptographic Lifecycle

E[5. Sunset] --> A[1. Initiation]
```

##### Phase 1: Initiation

- Gather requirements for the new cryptographic system

This should include the specific confidentiality, integrity, and availability objectives of the organization based upon the sensitivity of the information that will be protected. 

**Security Objectives**

##### Phase 2: Development and Acquisition

- Find an appropriate combination of hardware, software, and algorithms that meet objectives

##### Phase 3: Implementation and Assessment

- Configure and test the cryptographic system

##### Phase 4: Operation and Maintenance

- Ensure the continued secure operation of the cryptographic system

##### Phase 5: Sunset

- Phase out the system and destroy/archive keying material
